We appreciate your help with creating various test files to validate rendering.

All test files for rendering should be placed in appropriate subdirectory at "rendering/sources/".

Test file should be created using Synfig Studio version 1.0.2 (exactly this version). You can download it here - https://sourceforge.net/projects/synfig/files/releases/1.0.2/.

For creating a layer use "Layer" -> "Create Layer" menu command.

Please make sure to use ".sif" format when saving your file (not ".sifz").

For general usage of Synfig see documentation - https://wiki.synfig.org/Category:Manual.
